# Time-series-analysis [Macroeconomic Data]
Univariate Time Series Analysis ‚Äì Inflation Rate in Zambia [CASE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES]üìä

üìå Introdcution and Objectives of the Project.

Inflation is a key macroeconomic indicator that directly impacts economic stability, business operations, and financial decision-making. In this project, we analyze Zambia‚Äôs inflation rate using time-series techniques to uncover trends, seasonality, and irregularities. The goal in this project is to forecast future inflation rates and evaluate economic impact , particularly for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) borowing capacity and influence with other macroeconomic indicators. To carry out this we use entirely utilize Eviews as our statistical software for Statistical analysis and visualization.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Explore and visualize trends in a key macroeconomic variable (Inflation Rate).
- What is inflation üí°?? Inflation refers to the general increase in the price of goods and services over time, leading to a decline in the purchasing power of money. It is typically measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The causes of inflation are quite a number such as Demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, monetary expansion, and its effect is higher cost of living, reduced purchasing power, increased borrowing costs. In zambia, inflation is measure at National and provincial level, we will look at Total, Non-Food and Food Inflation from January 2011 upto January 2025. 

Let us visualize these trends and cary out descriptive statistics for all three inflation categories. Data is already in foreign file [xlsv] we need to import in Eview to begin the analysis.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Time-series decomposition.
Identifying long-term trends, seasonality, and irregularities.

- Trend: Long-term pattern (e.g., Is inflation increasing or decreasing over decades?).

- Seasonality: Repeating patterns at regular intervals (e.g., Does inflation spike in certain months due to fuel price adjustments or harvest cycles?).
  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Testing for stationarity and Unit Root
Applying transformations if necessary.

- Why does it matter? Most forecasting models assume stationarity for accurate predictions.
  
- How to test? We use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Building a forecasting model
- In particular (ARIMA) model to predict future values.The AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a powerful tool for inflation forecasting.

üìä Steps:
- Identify optimal parameters (p, d, q) using ACF/PACF plots.

- Train ARIMA model on historical inflation data.

- Evaluate forecasting accuracy using RMSE and MAPE.

- Generate inflation forecasts for the quater 4 months of 2025.
  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate economic implications on:
- SME's [Small and Medium Enterprises
- Overal Wages.
